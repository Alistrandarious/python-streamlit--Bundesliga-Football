# python-streamlit--seriesA-football

Very simply, this was a project that explored Streamlit - a data science/data analysis tool that allows you to host your project online.

The underlying data I used was from the Bundesliga 2021 tournement and focused on top scorers. I challenged myself as I am not a football fan and wanted to explore
the data to see what I could find out.

I looked into shots, goals - in terms of precision and who was the best. It seems R. Lewindowski is pretty legendary, and that midfielders are quite impressive at the
top end of the data.

I even looked into aggression. I wanted to see what was going on there. I was suprised to find out that rulebreaking was not as strategic as I thought, but was perhaps a
worse off strategy for the team and the game in general.
